# Version Control
> Version Control refers to services such as GitHub - these tools organize are code and the updates we make to them through time.

This document will list key commands (for now; used in the powershell terminal of VSCode) to get the service up and running

**git** init

(in a *new* folder (work from the desktop for easier use case) this will initialize your local folder for use of the git services.)

**git** add *filename*.ext        or             **git** add .

This commands *adds* a certain file or all latest versions of all fills into "staging" mode.

**git** commit -m "*message here*"

finalizes the staging with a user's message of commitment for the remote git repository.

**git** push remote origin
