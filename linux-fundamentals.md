# Linux Fundamentals
> Regarding linux and bash commands - here is a reference for helpful commands to use while working with different distributions.

$ **mkdir** newfolderhere

mkdir is short for "make directory", text following this command will name a new folder to be created at the current location of the path.

$ **cd** newfolderhere

cd (change directory) - this command will navigate you in or out of a folder

$ **touch** newfile.txt

touch (add something new) -this creates a new file in the current folder

$ **vi** newfile.txt

vi (visual) is used to change the contents of a file - there are a couple of things to remember when using this editor: 
- i is pressed to start 'insert' mode.
- esc is pressed to exit 'insert' mode.
- w stands for write [+enter]
- q stands for quit 
- wq [+enter] will write and quit the vi editor

- if you are given an error for quitting without a proper save - you can enter q! to force quit.
